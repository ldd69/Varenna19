\subsection{Data distributions}
\label{eq:data-distr}
For each experiment we want to check the experimental covariance matrix that has
been implemented in the \nnpdf code. Ideally we want this check to be
implemented as part of \valid. 

We should always work in the basis of eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The
first step when implemnting experiments should be the diagonalization of the
covariance matrix, checking the eigenvectors. The matrix should also be
projected on the nearest positive definite matrix, so that any numerical
instability is under control.
